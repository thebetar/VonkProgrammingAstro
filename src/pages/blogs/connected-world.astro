					In today&#39;s interconnected world, having a strong network is more important than ever. Whether
					you&#39;re an entrepreneur looking to grow your business, search for a job and trying to land your
					dream role, or simply someone with a groundbreaking idea, connections can open doors that might
					otherwise remain closed. Social media like LinkedIn have revolutionized the way we expand our
					networks, allowing us to reach more people. However, it&#39;s important to remember that even
					without these digital tools, we&#39;re often more connected than we realize.
				</p>
				<h2 id="using-your-local-network">Using your local network</h2>
				<p>
					Many people underestimate the reach of their own local network. It&#39;s easy to forget just how
					many people are within arm&#39;s reach. You also don&#39;t just have access to the people you know
					directly. If your message resonates, it could ripple through your contacts to their connections, and
					beyond.
				</p>
				<p>
					Think about it, most people have direct access to their family, friends, coworkers, people they meet
					through hobbies, and old classmates. If you have something that captures the interest of these
					people your outreach can quickly grow. When each person shares your messges with just a small amount
					of people you could already reach hundreds, if not thousands, of potential supporters, clients, or
					partners.
				</p>
				<h2 id="being-connected-versus-being-good">Being connected versus being good</h2>
				<p>
					In a perfect world, the best person for the job would always have the easiest time getting the job.
					But the reality is often different. There are two main reasons for this disconnect.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Firstly, human nature plays a role.</strong> Despite our best efforts to be rational and objective,
					we&#39;re emotional beings. We naturally prefer people we like, trust, and have had positive experiences
					with. Let&#39;s be honest, wouldn&#39;t you prefer to collaborate with someone you&#39;ve worked with
					before and enjoyed working with? Most of us would.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong
						>Secondly, it&#39;s not just about the quality of work, but also about fitting into the team.</strong
					> A person might be incredibly skilled, but if they don’t fit well into the team, it can create challenges.
					When someone is already known and liked by one or some members of the team, there&#39;s a level of confidence
					that they will integrate well, making the decision to hire or collaborate with them much easier.
				</p>
				<p>
					These points highlight that being well-connected can be just as important as being good at what you
					do. Of course, the ideal scenario is to be great in both areas.
				</p>
				<h2 id="the-value-of-connections">The value of connections</h2>
				<p>
					Having a broad network of people who like you and the work you do is a significant asset. But how do
					you maintain and expand a network? The answer might be simpler than you think.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the most effective ways to meet new people is by attending events. Whether it&#39;s a
					conference, a workshop, or a social gathering organized by your company, these events are full of
					opportunities to connect and meet new people. These environments are ideal for both entrepreneurs
					and professionals in the business world.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>For entrepreneurs,</strong> attending business events can be a goldmine for networking. These
					events are filled with potential clients, business partners, and even investors. It’s a numbers game
					in the end and by meeting enough people, you increase your chances of finding those who are a good fit
					for your business.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>For professionals working within a company,</strong> participating in social events or business
					wide meetings can be beneficial. Not only does it expand your internal network, but it can also enhance
					your work performance. Knowing people from different sections or levels of the company can improve communication
					and productivity.
				</p>
				<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					Humans are inherently social creatures, and throughout history, connections have played a vital role
					in personal and professional success. It might be disheartening to acknowledge, but sometimes being
					well-liked can be more advantageous than being highly skilled. However, imagine the possibilities if
					you can achieve both. By building strong relationships and continuously honing your skills, you can
					position yourself for success.
				</p>
				<p>
					So, start growing your network today, both online and offline. You never know which connection might
					be the one that sets you up for success.
