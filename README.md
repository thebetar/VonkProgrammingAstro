# Portfolio website VonkProgramming

Welcome to my portfollio website. This is the second version if my portfolio website the first can be found in my account under the repository name `VonkProgrammingVue`.
After building the first project in Vue.js I have decided since it is only a portfolio website to rebuild it in plain astro without the use of a framework.

## What you can find in this repo

Like in the last repository for my portfolio website I will also try to adhere to all coding standards in this repository.
