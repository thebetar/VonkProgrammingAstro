# Portfolio website VonkProgramming

Welcome to my portfollio website. This is the second version if my portfolio website the first can be found in my account under the repository name `VonkProgrammingVue`.
After building the first project in Vue.js I have decided since it is only a portfolio website to rebuild it in plain astro without the use of a framework.

## What you can find in this repo

Like in the last repository for my portfolio website I will also try to adhere to all coding standards in this repository.

Coding standards that can be found here are

-   Linting
-   Hooks
-   Pipeline that performs checks
-   Optimized build
-   Optimized hosting (apache)
-   Minimalism

Within this project there are no unit tests or other tests since this is a static website.
I would recommend at least using Cypress for testing if the website does contain functionality.
